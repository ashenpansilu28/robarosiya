                            By its name, university is meant to be a place where people get the universal knowledge in different directions.
                            A mixture of personalities from all over the country/ world are brought together within this organization.

                <h2>WHEN WE BORN.</h2>
                <p>The students who enter the University are talented and it is undeniable. But they are students of different mentalities and different economical levels. Although some have an idea of the purpose of what they are learning, most of them do not have a specific target. We know from the education methodology, that mostly students are not responsible for this situation.
                    Although it is being only five years since its inception, Roberosiya is now much loved by many students and our main goal is to improve students mental health and strengthen career guidance.

                        </div>
                        <p class="article-part1">Of course the word "situationship" should not familiar to you. Though the word is not familiar to us, 
                            these types of cases can be seen in our society, especially in universities. So, let`s see what is a "situationship".
                             A friendship that is more than friends but less than an exact relationship is called a 
                             "situationship". When talking about this topic, the film "No strings attached' always comes to my mind.
                             Although it has a happy end, life is more than a fantasy. For someone, this can be just hanging out and 
                             for another one, it can be more beyond that. The most important thing is that love can be in many forms 
                             and you don`t have to justify your feelings to anyone. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="article-full-right">
                        <p class="article-part2">Situationships can be worked, or don't.
                             But it is riskier than a normal relationship since both people do not owe any promise to each other. 
                             It is left up in the expectations, and the future. However, the uncertainty in a situationship can badly affect your mental health.
                              People in a situationship can also struggle with a decrease in self-esteem or a sense of loneliness from the possible lack of affection.
                               In a situationship because of the inability to get the other person to commit you may feel rejected and you may feel you are not valued.
                                According to Dianne Grande Ph.D., we need someone else to validate ourselves as worthy in the paradox of self-esteem.
                                "In situationships, we may tend to think “Why won't they date me?” and “Am I not perfect enough for them?” etc.
                                 When we do not feel validated that can be most harmful to our mental health.<br> <br>
                            Then how we can come up from this detrimental situation? First of all, if you are a person who is in a situationship and you are thinking that you made a stupid decision, you have to stop blaming yourself. 
                            Because as humans, we all have feelings and they can differ from each other. 
                            And we have to understand the fact our situationship can be worked or not. 
                            We should be ready for both. It will save us from future disappointments. 
                            You should trust your support system. 
                            That means you can spend more time with your family or friends, and seeing a therapist also can be a better idea. 
                            It will distract you from negative feelings and also cheer you up. Then you must create some space for yourself. 
                            You can unfollow him/her on social media and delete the contact. 
                            Journaling is a very good habit to get rid of this kind of situationship. 
                            Make a list of what you want to look for next time in a romantic partner and remind yourself why this particular person didn't work out. 
                            Finally and most importantly, self-care is the best remedy. 
                            Do things that make you happy, take a bubble bath, drink a coffee, go for a day out, etc.<br>
                            The best thing that can be taken from a situationship is the lessons you learned about yourself. 
                            By learning those, you can grow as a person. Your soul-mate will be somewhere on the earth. 
                            Is your "situationship" damaged your mental health?

                        <p class="article-part1">Before diving into the article, if these four letters make no sense to you at all, I suggest you to go through 'Myers Briggs Type Indicator' and find out which four letters belong to you. If you got 'INFJ' which refers to Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeler and Judger then you represent the world's rarest personality type which I say is a blessing to have. You'll say why once you notice 'The counsellor' in the topic. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="article-full-right">
                        <p class="article-part2">These people are surely different from others and often misunderstood with their usual quietness and hard-to-predict nature, yet they are exceptionally good at reading others with their rich and deep emotional intelligence. Rather than giving life a quantitative value, they tend to use qualitative approaches containing humanism and altruism to uplift others out of compassion. Despite having a different wavelength than others they tend to empathize with others which makes them great counsellors while most of them regard their life mission as to make the world a better place. No wonder INFJs are rare, right?  <br> <br>
                            No matter how good they are INFJs also cannot get rid of their dark side too. While they excel in empathy, they keep themselves reserved and do not open up even to people in their inner circle which will lead them through loneliness and depression. INFJs tend to be oversensitive, especially towards others' emotional expressions, which will make them emotionally overloaded and eventually lose the capability to cope with it. They usually seek perfection in what they do making them overwhelmed when confronted. <br>
                            Well, with all these facts who will hate to have an INFJ around or who'll never feel proud to be recognized as an INFJ? But it,s not easy as it seems to be candles that light up others accepting the fact that with time they will wear out. If you are an INFJ yourself, know where your limit is and give the same attention that you provide others to yourself too. If you are lucky enough to have an INFJ around please be kind enough to spare some time not to talk but to listen to him/her.

                                    Speaking of which, have you ever wondered why upbeat music makes you joyful?

                        <p class="article-part2">Psychological findings states, that music is likely to boost happy hormones (dopamine and serotonin) within you. A 2013 study in the “Journal of positive psychology” also revealed that listening to upbeat music has a higher chance of improving our moods and boosting happiness in just two weeks.<br>
                            Then what about sad songs? Do they always make you sad or do they sometimes make you feel good and lift your spirits? While gloomy music brings you grief, sometimes it might also make you feel cheerful. Recent research done by Durham University, UK, and the University of Jyväskylä in Finland stated even sad music can lift your mood bringing pleasure, and inspire confidence and comfort.
                            <br> <br>
                            Why?  
                            <br> <br>
                                    From a biological perspective, sad songs tend to release Prolactin and Oxytocin within us when we face actual life losses and empathize with another's pain. These hormones calm us, console and support us. Similarly, a psychological point of view implies sad music as an imaginary friend, as if it cares for you and acts as a cathartic release of emotions. This is because slow beats which have less going helps your mind to wander. You are more likely to resonate with what you are going through and allow you to be emotionally balanced in life, spilling your bag of heavy feelings whenever you need to.
